# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project will analyze fundraiser data from the "Kickstarting with Excel Data" and provide actionable analysis for Louise's Kickstarter campaign selection.
### Purpose
The purpose is to use the data provided to assist Louise with the selection of a campaign goal and the preferred Kickstarter campaign to lunch date.
## Analysis and Challenges
The theater category saw a significant increase in success during the months May and June compared to other months of the year. There weren't notable challenges. If the data wasn't cleaned prior to analysis I believe there might have been challenges with NULLS and empty data fields.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png data showed a higher success rate for plays lunched in the month of May. Louise could leverage this data to increase the probability of a successful campaign.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Outcome_vs_Goals.png data shows that is critical to set realistic goals. Goals greater than 45000 had the highest failure rate vs all other goal ranges. Louise's highest success came from Goals that were set less than 1000.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges or difficulties encountered, however there could be unforeseen variables outside the scope of the given data that has not been considered for Louise to achieve the best possible outcome.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The Theater_Outcomes_vs_launch data showed the launch dates with the higher probability of success were during the spring and summer months with May and June being the highest two months. Launching a play during the end of the calendar year decreases the rate of success.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The data shows severe goal failure for ranges greater than 45000. Goals of 1000 and less saw the highest number of success.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A possible limitation of this dataset would be the lack of more data. Having at least a 3-year dataset would prove valuable to back-test of variance in seasonality.
One potential limitation is the lack visibility to the population per capita and the demographic per location. Having access to the demographic per location vs theater play type could provide solid insight into the probability of success vs failure. Having access to the population per capita of each location provided in the Kickstarter dataset could also increase the probability of success.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - A location filtered graph of Outcome vs Launch Date could show Louise the location of the highest probability success.
